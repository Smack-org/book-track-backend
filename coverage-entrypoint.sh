# Create coverage report, calling coverage module in separate process.
# Why not doing it outside the container? Because of path mapping issue.
# Everything in .coverage database is calculated against docker internal paths.
# On the host, rootfs is different, paths locations are different, thus we better
# generate the report in there, inside this container, and analyse it outside.
